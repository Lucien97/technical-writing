- Project plan and work distribution

3. Outline design:
- Create DITAtopic and DITAmap
- Review and optimization

#### Development

1. Main activities
- Topic writing and review
- Pre-view and optimization

2. Requirements:
- Follow the principles of writing concept, task and reference
- Understand the standard of DITA/XML. Use correct marks.
- Follow the rules on terminology and reuse. Ensure the consistency and speed up the development
  
3. Output
- XML files, with all possible media, in source language.

#### Translation and localization

Pipeline: pre-processing, output and submit for translation, translation and localization, input and proofreading

Output: XML files, with all possible media, in target language.

#### Review and release

Work cycle: review/test and release
